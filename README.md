# Will You Be My Valentine? ❤️

This is a special and interactive webpage created with love to ask a very important question:  
**Will you be my Valentine?**  

## 💜 Features:  
- A beautiful **purple gradient background** (because it's my favorite).  
- Cute **"Yes" and "No" buttons**, but the **"No" button moves away** when you try to click it. *Juu mbona useme no????* 😆  
- A sweet **animation** when you say "Yes." *Niliona itakaa cute.*  
- A lovely **sound effect** to make the moment magical.

## ❤️ Why I Made This:  
I wanted to do something **special, something different**—something that would make you smile. 
This page is just a small way to show how much I appreciate and adore you. 
Watching you chase the **"No" button** before finally clicking **"Yes"** is my way of making you laugh before you say what I already know in my heart.  

### So... **Will you be my Valentine?** 💖  

**With Love,**  
Rajam
